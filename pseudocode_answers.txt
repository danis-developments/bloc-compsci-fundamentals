I added a bit of markdown syntax here for readability, and I didn't bother with a git repo for this because I didn't feel like it made much sense. This is stored in a pseudocode_answers.txt file, though.


Why do programmers use pseudocode?
It helps programmer's express ideas without referring to a specific language's syntax. 
This allows multiple programmers with different backgrounds to work out how to solve a problem together.


If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
It wouldn't run. It would throw an error or errors because pseudocode doesn't have the proper syntax for any programming language.

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

-Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
```
GET 2 numbers
PRINT the bigger number
```

alternatively if we wanted to be more procedural/less declarative
```
GIVEN firstNumber and secondNumber
IF firstNumber > secondNumber
 PRINT firstNumber
ELSE IF secondNumber > firstNumber
 PRINT secondNumber
ELSE 
 DO NOTHING
```
-Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
```
FOR the numbers 1 to 100
  PRINT the current number
ENDFOR
```
-Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
I am assuming we are looking for the entry's location since we already know the entry's data.

```
GIVEN a specific phonebook entry we are looking for
FOR each entry in the phonebook
  IF the current entry equals the specific phonebook entry we are looking for
    RETURN the current entry's location
    EXIT the FOR loop
  ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

```javascript
function getPhonebookEntry(entry, phonebookArr){
  for(let i=0; i < phonebookArr.length; i++){
    if(phonebookArr[i] === entry){
      return i;
    }
  }
}
```
